So, for this subject, we need to choose a different container for each exercise:

As Exercise 00 contains key-value pairs (date/value), which also need to be in
chronological order, the container MAP is perfect.

Exercise 01 is about reverse Polish notation, which reads one "word" after
another. So a STACK is a good way to go.

Exercise 02 needs containers to compare the sorting time of ints. Therefore
DEQUE and VECTOR can be used, since they behave similarly and are something
like advanced arrays...
